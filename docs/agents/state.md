# 任务状态

## 当前状态

Bandgap-conditioned CSP training-design task COMPLETE. Proposal experiments/mattergen/csp/TRAINING_PLAN.md source-verified: existing GSS CSP, species-fixed native denoising, DFT gap condition, adapter-first freezing, CFG dropout, polymorph coverage and split-provenance gates, explicit property-loader forwarding, matched post-relaxation evaluation. No training/server job/data preprocessing launched.

## 当前计划

Proposed next implementation order: labeled dataset/polymorph/pretraining overlap audit; local adapter and property-loader implementation plus invariance/gradient/config tests;200optimizer-stepSlurmGPUprofile;2000-5000step feasibility pilot with attainable within-composition targets and relaxed evaluation. Hyperparameters and compute cost are unverified proposals. Await training implementation direction; existing results preserved.

## 变更记录

- 2026-10-22 11:52:26 +08:00：开始 Guqq2 连接及网络设置同步；仅进行轻量 SSH 与网络诊断，不读取实验结果、不提交计算作业。缺少已确认 Git remote，不进行推测性 clone。

- 2026-10-22 11:55:16 +08:00：完成 Guqq2 网络同步验证与文档记录；仅关闭本任务代理，确认 1080 无监听。现有用户普通会话保持不变。

- 2026-10-22 12:20:36 +08:00：开始应用户请求核实 Guqq2 GPU 数量；仅执行轻量状态查询。


- 2026-10-22 12:23:59 +08:00：完成 GPU 清单和 Slurm 状态查询；确认单张 RTX 5090 当前空闲。

- 2026-10-30T16:25:26: Conditional trajectory implementation phase complete; ten tests and syntax checks passed. Enter synchronization/Slurm run stage. Cached native bandgap checkpoint and both environments confirmed; server idle at preflight. Native joint generation differs from fixed-composition CSP; MASK gaps remain unavailable.

- 2026-10-30T16:29:45: Additional stage-analysis implementation complete with seven tests. GPU505 observed healthy on node42; first conditional batch completed81.08s. Next submit CPU-only phase analysis after audit506.

- 2026-10-30T16:40:45: GPU/primary audit/phase jobs505/506/507 complete successfully. Enter final reporting QA: revise empty fixed-cohort panel and persist same-path force summary; rerun CPU only, verify raw hashes unchanged, then download final figures and document interpretation. No inference, training or relaxation rerun.

- 2026-10-30T16:47:30: Final artifact QA exposed a stale prior-stage SVG checksum; raw trajectories and predictions unchanged. Ownership regression now passes ten tests. Reenter CPU artifact integration; no GPU rerun needed.

- 2026-10-30T16:52:08: Conditional trajectory task COMPLETE. GPU505 sampling/evaluation and all required CPU audits complete; final CPU510 fixed manifest ownership and passed. Local final archive/raw/model hashes/figures/numeric documentation verified. No active jobs submitted by this task remain; no proxy holder was started. Deliver figures, data and stage explanation.

- 2026-10-30T17:03:27: Public checkpoint availability verification COMPLETE; requested direct download has no verified matching public target. No global nonexistence claim: weight-only opaque repositories unverified. Documented exact scope/evidence; retain existing cached weights. Further CSP property fine-tuning or clamped joint-model sampling would be separate work, not silently substituted.

- 2026-10-30T17:13:10: Training-design task COMPLETE. Concrete protocol and implementation/test boundaries recorded and source-checked. Next experimental unit would audit labeled polymorph coverage, then implement adapter/loader flow and200optimizer-stepSlurmGPUprofile before5000-step-scale pilot; these have not been run.
